# Batsu!

Batsu! is an application designed to help people keep accountable when meeting with others at created events.  
Within the application, users are able to create an event, invite other users, and track who arrives and who does not.  
Those that are late or do not show up will receive a punishment that is set within the application.  The application
uses GoogleMaps API to geo-locate the event's position, React.js and Redux for the logical application, and CSS3 and Bootstrap4 for styling.

A. Prerequisite: 

   All prototypes require npm to be installed on your local machine because our project is using React. Please take following steps to set up the project environment:
   1. npm install
   2. npm install --save react-router-dom
   3. npm install --save axios
   4. npm install --save react-modal
   5. npm install --save react-burger-menu
   6. npm install --save react-image-slider
   7. npm install --save react-places-autocomplete


   The prototypes also require a LAMP/MAMP stack. Rename "mysql_connect.php.config" to "mysql_connect.php" and fill out your MySQL username and password credentials.
